/*
 * Peterson's algorithm for mutual exclusion:
 * http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-0190(81)90106-X
 *
 * This version uses two threads, A and B, and separate views for each.
 * A lot of duplication occurs that may be removable with arrays.
 *
 * It models getting the current turn and the other lock's ticket as one
 * atomic action.
 *
 * This proof was manually written: future exercises could involve
 * making it easier to synthesise parts of it.
